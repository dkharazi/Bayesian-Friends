## Overview

One way to understand the popularity for certain areas of eductions within universities is by looking at who the universities employ and how employees are compensated. An engineering professional association is interested in comparing the salaries of senior faculty working at top universities across engineering subdisciplines using a Bayesian model. The association performed a survey in order to collect data on faculty salaries, which has been recorded in the "salaries.csv" dataset. This data file includes the salaries (in 1000s of dollars) of 297 professors and their subdisciplines, for 8 areas of education: biomedical (BM), chemical (CH), civil (CV), computer science (CS), electrical (EE), industrial (IN), material science (MS), and mechanical (MC).
